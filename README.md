# PTGym

A responsive website for a niche gym. I've been seeing a lot of nice single-page websites around and figured I should try my hand at one while practicing how to use CSS Flexbox. I also added some small Javascript and JQuery elements to this one, as opposed to my last project, which was purely HTML/CSS. I used Javascript for Google Maps API and JQuery for the smooth-scrolling effect.
